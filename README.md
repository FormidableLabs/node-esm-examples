Node.js ESM Examples
====================

Examples with Node.js runtimes and modern ESM support.

## Installation

The examples presently only run on a Bash-like OS / environment.

To run these samples, you will need [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and the following Node.js runtimes:

```sh
$ nvm install 10.24.1
$ nvm install 12.22.6
$ nvm install 14.17.6
```

We require the actual versions to speed up execution of known runtimes.
